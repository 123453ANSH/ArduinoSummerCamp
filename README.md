# ArduinoSummerCamp
During 2019 summer, I created and taught an Arduino Summer Camp which teaches students how to control the Arduino microcontroller to manipulate circuits and electronic devices in general. Students also learn essential the mechanical principles surrounding the creation of a robot. 

Here is a general overview of what this camp teaches: 

- C Programming
- Circuit Design
- Arduino Microcontroller Programming
- Programming Logic and Control Flow
- Circuitry and Energy Distribution/Calculation
- External Sensor Integration with Arduino
- Reading and Drawing Schematic Diagrams
- Mechanical and Structural Design
- 3D Design with Autodesk and Tinkercad Software

More in depth explanation of what this camp teaches can be found at the camp website: https://camp.irvingtonrobotics.org. Here is the entire curriculum for this camp (68 page google doc!) - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hnA_M21V7KzfzMXNgYr_3TLTaFQ4t47D7AhJW7wjtH8/edit?usp=sharing. This doc is also a file in this repo, if this is easier to access. Finally, here is a link to a folder containing documents we used to teach students this camp - . These documents are meant to be learnt one a day. The folder is also on this repo if it is easier to access. 

The programming projects and concepts taught to students are right here, in case anyone wants to self-learn this course for free :).
